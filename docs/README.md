### Disclaimer

To get the plotly .html elements to display in browser, I've copied all the files in this repository to a repository I have ownership of, and used GitHub pages to display the .html file in browser.

For your convenience, I recommend marking using this repository:

[hw05-lucymosquera-html-friendly](https://github.com/lucymosquera/hw05-lucymosquera-html-friendly)

And specifically, this file URL which displays my .html document in browser:

[hw05-R-exercises.html](https://lucymosquera.github.io/hw05-lucymosquera-html-friendly/hw05-R-exercises.html)

The files in the html friendly repository and this repository should be identical!

# Goal

* Reorder a factor in a principled way based on the data and demonstrate the effect in arranged data and in figures.
* Write some data to file and load it back into R.
* Improve a figure (or make one from scratch), using new knowledge, e.g., control the color scheme, use factor levels, smoother mechanics.
* Make a plotly visual.
* Implement visualization design principles.
